# NFTrials
## A decentralized application built on the polygon blockchain using the Diamond-3-Hardhat Implementation Standard (ERC2535) and Typechain support

## NFTrials is a free to play game that allows players to earn NFTs. Each player has equal chance of winning. NFTrials also seeks to acquaint players with the concept of NFTs while promoting African culture by integrating art created by Africans. 

## Players get access to the game by first connecting their wallet. After successfully connecting, they proceed to a page where they get a trial per day to correctly guess the right combination that reveal an NFT. The combination of each NFT of the day is divided into six (6) components. These components are randomly distributed into eighteen (18) different tiles from which players make their guesses. 

## Players that successfully guess all six components get rewarded with an NFT. Similarly, players with the highest number of correct guesses are featured in the leaderboard.

### Diamond-3-Hardhat Implementation + Typechain Support

This is a simple example implementation for [EIP-2535 Diamond Standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/2535). To learn about other implementations go here: https://github.com/mudgen/diamond

The standard loupe functions have been gas-optimized in this implementation and can be called in on-chain transactions. However keep in mind that a diamond can have any number of functions and facets so it is still possible to get out-of-gas errors when calling loupe functions. Except for the `facetAddress` loupe function which has a fixed gas cost.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo:
```console
git clone https://github.com/Timidan/diamond-3-hardhat.git
```

2. Install NPM packages:
```console
cd diamond-3-hardhat
npm install or yarn install
```

## Deployment

```console
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

## Run tests:
```console
npx hardhat test
```

## Upgrade a diamond

Check the `scripts/deploy.ts` and or the `test/diamondTest.ts` file for examples of upgrades.

Note that upgrade functionality is optional. It is possible to deploy a diamond that can't be upgraded, which is a 'Single Cut Diamond'.  It is also possible to deploy an upgradeable diamond and at a later date remove its `diamondCut` function so it can't be upgraded any more.

Note that any number of functions from any number of facets can be added/replaced/removed on a diamond in a single transaction. In addition an initialization function can be executed in the same transaction as an upgrade to initialize any state variables required for an upgrade. This 'everything done in a single transaction' capability ensures a diamond maintains a correct and consistent state during upgrades.

## Facet Information

The `contracts/Diamond.sol` file shows an example of implementing a diamond.

The `contracts/facets/DiamondCutFacet.sol` file shows how to implement the `diamondCut` external function.

The `contracts/facets/DiamondLoupeFacet.sol` file shows how to implement the four standard loupe functions.

The `contracts/libraries/LibDiamond.sol` file shows how to implement Diamond Storage and a `diamondCut` internal function.

The `scripts/deploy.ts` file shows how to deploy a diamond.

The `test/diamondTest.ts` file gives tests for the `diamondCut` function and the Diamond Loupe functions.

## How to Get Started Making Your Diamond

1. Reading and understand [EIP-2535 Diamonds](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/2535). If something is unclear let me know!

2. Use a diamond reference implementation. You are at the right place because this is the README for a diamond reference implementation.

This diamond implementation is boilerplate code that makes a diamond compliant with EIP-2535 Diamonds.

Specifically you can copy and use the [DiamondCutFacet.sol](./contracts/facets/DiamondCutFacet.sol) and [DiamondLoupeFacet.sol](./contracts/facets/DiamondLoupeFacet.sol) contracts. They implement the `diamondCut` function and the loupe functions.

The [Diamond.sol](./contracts/Diamond.sol) contract could be used as is, or it could be used as a starting point and customized. This contract is the diamond. Its deployment creates a diamond. It's address is a stable diamond address that does not change.

The [LibDiamond.sol](./contracts/libraries/LibDiamond.sol) library could be used as is. It shows how to implement Diamond Storage. This contract includes contract ownership which you might want to change if you want to implement DAO-based ownership or other form of contract ownership. Go for it. Diamonds can work with any kind of contract ownership strategy. This library contains an internal function version of `diamondCut` that can be used in the constructor of a diamond or other places.

## Calling Diamond Functions

In order to call a function that exists in a diamond you need to use the ABI information of the facet that has the function.

Here is an example that uses ethers.js:

```typescript
let myUsefulFacet = await ethers.getContract(facetName,diamondDeployedAddress) as facetNameType;
```


```solidity
string result = MyUsefulFacet(address(diamondContract)).getResult()
```
